I argue that divergent patterns of engagement, rather than variations in material capacity, define and produce status inequalities between member states at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The result is a social hierarchy that priveleges certain states over others, despite the Agency's nominal commitment to soveregin equality.

Empirically, I illustrate and analyse this hierarchy via Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), commenting on its determinants and observing via clustering three patterns of member state participation that group high, mid, and low status states. Methodologically, I demonstrate the utility of FAMD over established MCA methods in better preserving not only ordinal rank—denoting position in the hierarchy—but also the relative difference between these ranks. 
  
This, I suggest, provides significant benefit in understanding hierarchy at the IAEA and other organisations where capacity and engagement vary greatly between states, particularly among those with high status.
