Unlike other international organisations, multilateral development banks (MDBs) make no pretence to the equality of their member states. This talk suggests that positional dissatisfaction within this system emerges not from inequality, so the prevailing wisdom at other organisations goes, but instead from inequity—a mismatch between a state’s de jure vote share and its broader economic capacity. This inconsistency is widely cited as a contributing factor to emerging market and developing economies’ discontent at established MDBs, and ultimately to the creation of EMDE favourable alternatives.

And yet, despite the apparent importance of member state hierarchies at MDBs, to date there has been no systematic enquiry into this 'voice gap' phenomenon. In doing so, I suggest that the relationship between a state’s organisational rank and its de jure vote share is far from clear. Research on UN system and multilateral security organisations, for example, suggests that indicators of de facto organisational status—emerging from disparate patterns of diplomatic engagement—better attest to organisational hierarchies than de jure structural indicators or naïve indicators of global ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ power. I conclude with illustrations of de jure and de facto hierarchies at the IBRD and IDA and suggest methods for analysis.
