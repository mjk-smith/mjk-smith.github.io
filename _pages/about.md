I'm a PhD student and Research Assistant at Griffith University specialising in international organisations, member hierarchies, and IO performance. specialising in multilateral development banks and the IAEA.
  
  
  
#### Recent Activity:
##### [IAEA Hierarchies Conference Paper](/talks/2022_09_APSA_IAEA) - Australian National Unviersity, Canberra - [APSA Conference September 2022](https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/events/2022-apsa-annual-conference)
I argue that divergent patterns of engagement, rather than variations in material capacity, define and produce status inequalities between member states  at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The result is a social hierarchy that priveleges certain states over others, despite the Agency's nominal commitment to soveregin equality.

Illustrating and analysing this hierarchy via Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) methods, I comment on its determinants and observe patterns of member state participation grouping high, mid, and low status states. Methodologically, I demonstrate the utility of FAMD over established methods 
in better preserving not only rank—a state's position in the hierarchy—but also the relative difference between ranks. This, I suggest, is provides significant benefit in understanding hierarchy at the IAEA where capacity and engagement varies greatly between states, particularly those with high status.
