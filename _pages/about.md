##### [IAEA Hierarchies Conference Paper](/talks/2022_09_APSA_IAEA) - Australian National Unviersity, Canberra - [APSA Conference September 2022](https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/events/2022-apsa-annual-conference)
In this paper I argue that divergent patterns of engagement, rather than variations in material capacity, define and produce status inequalities between member states  at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The result is a social hierarchy that privileges certain states over others, despite the Agency's nominal commitment to soveregin equality.

Empirically, I illustrate and analyse this hierarchy via Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), commenting on its determinants and observing—via cluster analysis—three patterns of member state participation that group high, mid, and low status states. Methodologically, I demonstrate the utility of FAMD over established MCA methods in better preserving not only ordinal rank—denoting a state's position in the hierarchy—but also the relative difference *between* these ranks. This, I suggest, is benefitial when investigating hierarchies at organisations where capacity and engagement vary greatly between states, particularly those with high status within the system.
